node-launcher is aiming to make a node IDE from eclipseJS

Download the plugin here http://code.abnoctus.com/publish/binaries/node-launcher/ and drop it in /plugins

By combing EclipseJS , goggle Developer Tools and a couple of simple pugins we get an IDE that supports

* syntax highlighting 
* code completion
* launching node
* debuggingg node
* workspace setup for npm managed modules
* fetching deps via npm
* npm search
* launching nodeunit tests 
* displaying nodeunit test results
* code templates for creating modules

If you code in vi you can safely ignore this project
